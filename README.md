# AXI DMA with Petalinux 

## Introduction
This repo contains the setup for implementing AXI DMA in Xilinx/AMD devices, for performing Memory Mapo MM2S and S2MM operations, using a User space mappable DMA Buffer ```u-dma-buf``` from [https://github.com/ikwzm/udmabuf](https://github.com/ikwzm/udmabuf). An example design is also provided with a simple loopback setup.
